# Catalysm-CSGO-config


All my settings and binds for CSGO.

## Installation

  Copy all .cfg files in this repo to your csgo cfg folder
  
  `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg`
  
  It will automatically execute all commands when you start your game. 
  If you're having trouble you can reload the script by writing `exec autoexec` to console.

## Features

* Assorted scripts bound to function keys
