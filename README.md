# Catalysm-CSGO-config


All my settings and binds for CSGO.

**This includes my personal controls! Make sure to delete these lines or change them to yours because you will lose your current settings.**

## Features

* Assorted scripts bound to function keys
* Buy binds on numpad and arrow keys. (run `exec autoexec` ingame and it will echo the settings to your console)
* Sensible defaults for network, video and viewmodel.
* Displays damage done when you die. Will display at top left of your screen.
* Radar zoom in and out buttons
* Volume up/down buttons. To control ingame volume without changing your Windows volume.
* Show netgraph when holding TAB
* Friends can join your community server without an invite
* Disable automatic weapon switch on pickup

## Installation

  Copy all .cfg files in this repo to your csgo cfg folder
  
  `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg`
  
  It will automatically execute all commands when you start your game. 
  If you're having trouble you can reload the script by writing `exec autoexec` to console.


## Scripts

* **F1 - buy drop script**
  
Buys an AK/M4 and drops it.

* **F2 - find the bomb script**

Enables the noob-tips. This will show a tooltip above the bomb, useful for finding it inside a smoke.

* **F3 - Crosshair changing script**

Cycles through crosshairs. See the misc file to configure your own crosshair(s).

* **F4 - Toggles voice chat on/off.**

Very useful to mute cyka blyat teammates during clutches.

* **F5 - Rapid fire**

Toggles rapid fire mode. This will rebind your mousewheel to shooting. Combine this with dualies/tec-9 for maximum power.

* **F6 - sm_admin**

Opens the SourceMod admin menu.

* **F7 - ready**

Say .ready. Made for lazy people like me.

* **F8 - /**

* **F9 - noclip**

Toggle noclip

* **F10 - /**

* **F11 - disconnect**

Instantly disconnects you from current server

* **F12 - Quit prompt**

Shows the quit prompt. 

## Other controls

These are located in cata-controls.cfg. Change to your desired keys

* v - Clear all blood and bullet holes from the map for better visibility
* f - Toggles weapon between left and right hand, I use this to hold certain angles better where your gun could block vision
* n - toggle "team wallhack", let's you see teammates names, nades and gun through walls
* Page up/down - ingame volume buttons
* End/home - Zoom radar in or out
* Space - jump throw

# Disclaimer

Please don't blindy copy and paste, it WILL override your settings (controls, binds, crosshair, viewmodel). Delete what you don't want or change to your own values! Be careful when using the jump throw script! It is banned on ESEA (and possibly other services aswell)
