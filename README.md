# Catalysm-CSGO-config


All my settings and binds for CSGO.

## Installation

  Copy autoexec.cfg to your csgo cfg folder:
  
  C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg
  
  It will automatically execute all commands when you start your game. 
  If you're having trouble you can reload the script by writing "exec autoexec" to console.

Please don't blindy copy and paste, it WILL override your settings (binds, crosshair, viewmodel).
Delete what you don't want or change to your own values!
